  <p>Hey there! I'm Connor, otherwise known as <b>@aconnorbug</b>, or possibly even <b>@itsatelo</b>! I'm a young and aspiring developer looking into founding my own company, dubbed Setrius Development.</b> Since I was 8 years old (back in 2012), I've had the dream of becoming a game developer, as other developers have inspired me! One of my ideals is to give inspiration to others, just like how I've received it way back when. Now, I'm fully working towards Setrius Development, and in the future, I will get started on making games and inspiring others!</p><br>
